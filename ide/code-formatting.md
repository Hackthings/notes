> I challenge anyone to give me a valid reason why **spaces** are better than **tabs**. I still have not heard a reason besides **"everyone uses spaces, so you should too"**. But that is a valid reason. IDE defaults, online examples, most companies' in-progress code bases usually use spaces. So, I will too. ü§ê  
  
  
#### Make sure your text-editor or IDE does not do strange things  
 to your code formatting. I have found that VsCode applies strange indentation and word wrapping to all code files, on save. Surely it's possible to adjust it to behave better, but instead I chose to use Sublime Text, which by default does not modify the file on save, and otherwise pretty much the same editor. **Prettier, which runs after any file has changed, or in a GIT pre-commit hook, is the best option, especially for JSX.**  
  
  
#### Here is a great online tool to quickly format some dirty code:

#### Different text editors will also format the file slightly differently.  
 Such slight inconsistencies will break your **`git diff`**, **`git merge`**, slow down day to day programming, and cause bugs in your app.  
  
#### Solution:  
Configure a formatting tool like Prettier, using your IDE settings, or NPM package.json script, so every team member will automatically run it on file-save or on before-commit. Agree with the team on standards,  to put into the config file `.prettierrc`. Commit that config file to version control, so all team members have it.
