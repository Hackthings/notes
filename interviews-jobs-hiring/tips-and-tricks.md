# Tips and tricks

## For employees \(starting a new job\):

Do not trust promises employers make, unless they are a legal contract. This goes especially for things like "one remote workday per week". That is temporary. Policies change. I've had little perks like this disappear very soon after I moved and started a job. 

Do not assume things will always be like when you started or interviewed. If a company is "remote-friendly" or has a laid back relaxing environment, this can change quickly, as management changes or the company grows.

California is over-rated. There are plenty of great jobs in un-conventional states, like Virginia or Utah. California tech companies are neurotic, pretentious, and terrible organizations to be a part of. Unless you already live and work in California, and are ok with this culture, do yourself a favor and stay away.
