## Tips for employees \(starting a new job\):

Do not assume things will always be like when you started or interviewed. If a company is "remote-friendly" or has a laid back relaxing environment, this can change quickly, as management changes or the company grows. Do not trust promises your employer makes, unless it is in a legal contract. This goes especially for \*policies\* like "one remote workday per week". Policies change. I've had little perks like this disappear very soon after I moved and started a job. 

California is over-rated. There are plenty of great jobs in other states, like Virginia or Utah. California tech companies are neurotic, pretentious, and terrible organizations to be a part of. Unless you already live and work in California, and are ok with this culture, do yourself a favor and stay away. In my experience, NYC \(known for its hustle and neurotic people\) has been much more relaxed, and the people there have been much more human, warm, kind, and pleasant than in California. IT IS NOT BECAUSE of "the liberals". Conservatives in Cali are also crazy and terrible. It is not limited to the tech industry. It is the people and culture itself. Everybody just seems like they are hunting each other and ready to fight. Everything feels like a contest. Driving and crossing the street feels dangerous. California far from the hippie surfer heaven it was in the past. There are still good communities of peaceful people, like in Pasadena. That town is special - not just to live and work - but also to go out at night. Glendale is the complete opposite. Utah in my experience had the best people to work. Less egos. That was actually why NYC is great - New Yorkers do not get credit for how humble they are. In NYC, you're forced to be humble. It's because you're constantly interacting with people smarter than yourself - and unlike in California, where it feels like a contest, in NYC, nobody is looking at you, so you don't feel the need to prove yourself.
