# Tips and tricks

## For employees \(starting a new job\):

Do not trust promises employers make, unless they are a legal contract. This goes especially for things like "one remote workday per week". That is temporary. Policies change. I've had little perks like this disappear very soon after I moved and started a job. 

Do not assume things will always be like when you started or interviewed. If a company is "remote-friendly" or has a laid back relaxing environment, this can change quickly, as management changes or the company grows.
