# Tips and tricks

## For employees \(starting a new job\):

California is over-rated. There are plenty of great jobs in un-conventional states, like Virginia or Utah. California tech companies are neurotic, pretentious, and terrible organizations to be a part of. Unless you already live and work in California, and are ok with this culture, do yourself a favor and stay away. In my experience, NYC \(known for its hustle and neurotic people\) has been much more relaxed, and the people there have been much more human, warm, kind, and pleasant than in California. For people reading this - I want to stress - it's not the "liberal" politics in California which make the people unbearable. Conservatives in Cali are also crazy and terrible. It is the people and culture itself, and not just in the tech industry. 

Do not trust promises employers make, unless they are a legal contract. This goes especially for things like "one remote workday per week". That is temporary. Policies change. I've had little perks like this disappear very soon after I moved and started a job. 

Do not assume things will always be like when you started or interviewed. If a company is "remote-friendly" or has a laid back relaxing environment, this can change quickly, as management changes or the company grows.
