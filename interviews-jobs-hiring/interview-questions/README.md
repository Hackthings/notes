  Questions to ask your future team mates - as the interviewer - or as the
  interviewee!

# Topics for Discussion

**This entire section is filled with random notes** on possible interview questions, and how I would answer them. You gotta know which answers are good or bad, if you are trying to be objective when screening a candidate. Just chatting however, works just as well for finding a good well-rounded person to work with, if you're looking for a long-term relationship or don't require the top notch technical skills.

These are also questions I would ask my interviewer - to make sure we have compatible philosophies.
