# JavaScript quiz

## What's your favorite way to iterate \(loop over\) ...

1\) an array?   `for (let item of arr) { ...` or `arr.forEach((item, i) => { ...`  

2\) an object? `for (let key in obj) { let val = obj[key]; ...` 

3\) a sentence, word by word? `let i = 0; while (i < str.length) { i++; ...`  

## What are the differences between an array an an object ?

Person could say that an array actually is an object. In a way, that is true. Good start. However, if the person stops there, that's a red flag. What actually are the differences?...

## What's your favorite feature from the new ES6 JavaScript, which was not there in the old ES5?

This is a great question for general discussion, chit chat, getting to know each other's preferences and personality... but also, more importantly, it is a test to see if the interviewee   
1\) knows what the heck is the difference between ES5/ES6  
2\) has some beginner misconceptions about the features \(less experienced than say they are\)
