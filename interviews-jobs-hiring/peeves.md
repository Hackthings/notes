# Peeves

* Some programmers make a function for every new little bit of functionality, even if it's only ever used in one place. Maybe that's what they teach in a 4-year computer science degree, but from experience, I say it gets in the way much more often than it helps. 
* Unit testing 100% coverage. I'm not against unit testing 100% of functionality. But, some people interpret testing as having to test every line of code. Please, stop. I don't care how your function came up with the data it's outputting. Just test the input/output. The internals change often, and so unit testing every bit of internal code just doubles the work you have to do for the exact same result, without accomplishing anything.
