# Peeves

* Some programmers make a function for every new little bit of functionality, even if it's only ever used in one place. Maybe that's what they teach in a 4-year computer science degree, but from experience, I say it gets in the way much more often than it helps. 
* Someone assuming they're right, and refusing to budge. I've been guilty of this too. Just don't. 
* Unit testing 100% coverage. I'm not against unit testing 100% of functionality. But, some people interpret that as having to test every line of code. Please, stop. I don't care how your function came up with the data it's outputting. Just test the input/output. The internals change often, and so unit testing every bit of internal code just doubles the work you have to do for the exact same result. It doesn't accomplish anything. 
* Impostor syndrome. Do you think you're a bad programmer? not as good as your peers? don't belong in the company? about to get fired? You're probably doing just fine. Your colleagues probably respect you, or are even intimidated by you like you are of them, because they also have impostor syndrome. Everything is fine. You're much more likely to get a raise than to get fired. 
* Intermediate syndrome. Do you think you're amazing? The best programmer in the company? Best in town? Do you think you can do anything? Then you're probably actually pretty bad. Even if you can actually create a scalable and maintainable app quickly, can anyone else read your code? Teamwork is extremely important. Some programmers are much better or much worse than others, but it's still very very difficult to built solo. A team can usually do it faster and better. So, make sure other people are able to read your code, understand it, and contribute to it.
