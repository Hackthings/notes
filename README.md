### Welcome to my Javascript fan site  
**A collection of ideas, notes, and code snippets.**  
If I (or a team mate) has not dealt with an issue in a while and forgot how to do it, quickly look it up here (instead of spending time Googling).

### To document a "code base", the best solution is probably still [Documentation.JS](https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation/blob/master/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)  
```javascript  
    /**  
     * This function adds one to its input.  
     * @param {number} input any number  
     * @returns {number} that number, plus one.  
     */  
    function addOne(input) {  
      return input + 1;  
    }  
```
