# Node JS

Download NodeJS package \(pkg\) for Mac \(easiest way to install Node\):  
[https://nodejs.org/dist/](https://nodejs.org/dist/)

## What node processes running?

`ps cax | grep node;` returns process IDs  
`kill 1234` kill process by ID

`killall node` kill all node processes

Even better, use "PM2" to manage node processes!
