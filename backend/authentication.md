# API Authentication

**Developer:**  
if server is localhost, port &gt; 80, client is also localhost port &gt; 80  
**then allow access, return additional debugging data**

**Client:**  
if server is port 80, client from whitelisted RapidAPI IP  
**allow access**  
if also client header x-rapidapi-user === "wordio"  
**return additional debugging data, as if developer**

What if client spoofs domain/IP, fake RapidAPI credentials? I'm not checking RapidAPI credentials, only whitelisted IPs. **Check referrer IP generated by my server, not some header which can be custom set by client.** Research that it is accurate, can not be spoofed.

Above is with RapidAPI. It's easy! Standalone API needs more thought.
