Don't know where to stick this note, but, check out this company led by [Dmitriy Akulov](https://dakulov.com/)...

They contribute to amazing web tools like [JS Delivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), Survive JS, Bash, etc. I aspire to be like this guy some day. [https://dakulov.com/](https://dakulov.com/) Based on their affiliations and quality of previous work, it seems if ProspectOne likes something, it's worth learning and using, because if it's not big now, it will be or at least could be very useful.

This is cool - [https://www.jsdelivr.com/esm](https://www.jsdelivr.com/esm) - they build and serve ES Modules!  
Take my unfinished ES module, for example: [https://esm.run/universal-common-scripts/functions/requests.js](https://esm.run/universal-common-scripts/functions/requests.js)  
JSDeliver finishes it \(compiles and builds it\)! Then serves it via CDN! Amazing!
