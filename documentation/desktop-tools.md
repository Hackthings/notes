Notion is a big deal. The one, the only. The best for writing notes or documentation.

**I'm not including this in the list of website builders though**. Notion can not be used to create a website without a lot of hacking. It does generate and publish a webpage for you. However, it's just a webpage, not a site. No navigation. No custom domain.

This tool is something to watch. They may include publishing features \(API\) in the future.
