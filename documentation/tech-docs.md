# Website builders for technical documentation or knowledgebase

## [GitBook](https://gitbook.com)

It's a brilliant platform for editing Markdown docs. It generates a beautiful website from your markdown files. You can edit the ".md" files manually or use their GUI. After you save, your beautiful documentation website is generated and published automatically to your domain. It looks the best. 

Example: This site. Also [nlp.studio](https://nlp.studio)

## [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

Seems to be very capable. DIY, install and host it yourself.

Example: [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

## [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)

I hate it so much. The UI is so difficult to edit and navigate. Especially for a large and/or disorganized team, Confluence docs turn out to be such a mess!

But, it is the best tool for collaboration. Multiple people can be editing the same file, and it does not have merge conflicts or lose data. I want to go find their careers page and offer my UI/UX services, to do the world a favor. Ugh!
