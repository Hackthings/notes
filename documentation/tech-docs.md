# Website builders for technical documentation or knowledgebase

## [GitBook](https://gitbook.com)

It's a brilliant platform for editing Markdown docs. It generates a beautiful website from your markdown files. You can edit the ".md" files manually or use their GUI. After you save, your beautiful documentation website is generated and published automatically to your domain. It looks the best. 

Example: This site. Also [nlp.studio](https://nlp.studio)

## [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

Seems to be very capable. DIY, install and host it yourself.

Example: [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

## [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)

I hate it so much. Their UI is so buggy, and so cumbersome to use and navigate. Especially for a large and/or disorganized team, Confluence docs turn out to be such a mess, because everyone struggles with the UI, and thus does not organize things well, and does not document fully. People use it because they have to, and use it as little as possible, to get it over with. All this leads to confusing and incomplete documentation.

But, it is the best technology for collaboration. Multiple people can be editing the same file and it does not have merge conflicts or lose data. It does have many features. I just want to go find their careers page and offer my UI/UX services, to do the world a favor. Ugh!

I only use it if someone pays me, which sometimes happens. :\) It's much better than no documentation at all.
