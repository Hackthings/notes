# Website builders for technical documentation or knowledgebase

## [GitBook](https://gitbook.com)

It's a brilliant platform for editing Markdown docs. It generates a beautiful website from your markdown files. You can edit the ".md" files manually or use their GUI. After you save, your beautiful documentation website is generated and published automatically to your domain. It looks the best. 

Example: This site. Also [nlp.studio](https://nlp.studio)

## [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)

DIY, install and host it yourself. No API reference docs, but otherwise great content and UI.

MkDocs example: [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)  
Docusaurus example: [https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation)

## [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)

Ugh! Their UI is so buggy, so cumbersome to use and navigate. Especially for a large and/or disorganized team, Confluence docs turn out to be a big mess, because everyone struggles with all their bloated unwieldy UI. People use it because they have to, and use it as little as possible, to get it over with. All this leads to confusing and incomplete documentation.

But, it is the best technology for collaboration. Multiple people can be editing the same file without merge conflicts. It has very powerful permissions settings.
