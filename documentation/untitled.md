# GitBook

It's a brilliant platform for editing Markdown docs. It generates a beautiful website from your markdown files. You can edit the ".md" files manually or use their GUI. After you save, your beautiful documentation website is generated and published automatically to your domain.

## Embed on your own website

To share your documentation with the world, you have to direct people to the GitBook website. You can host it on your own domain and upload your logo, and it looks really nice. But, to remove their branding it's a minimum of $300/mo, and even then you can not add CSS or Javascript.

I figured out a work-around. Here is a step by step tutorial, how I used GitBook-generated HTML pages, including links, CSS, and JavaScript, but I hosted it on my own server. I was able to manipulate the site, remove their branding, and inject my own HTML/CSS/JavaScript:

## Try it! ... It's the best documentation platform!

It's similar to a documentation builder like [docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io), but GitBook has more content types, is easier to edit, and looks better. 

I've also used stoplight.io, which is the best GUI tool for writing API documenation. It lets you export your documentation as `.yaml` files, as a complete OpenAPI v3 / Swagger spec. It even lets you edit the yaml files manually, and corrects you when you've made a mistake or are missing a parameter. Unfortunately, I don't like it for documenting other things. It's not very intuitive, and not very good looking.

GitBook is very user-friendly, and generates a beautiful website. 

GitBook actually allows you to document your API spec, and it comes out looking really great - easy to read and navigate by the end user, which is what you want. Unfortunately, it does not yet allow you to import/export yaml/OpenAPI.
