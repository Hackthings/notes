## [Slate \(node-slate npm package\)](https://github.com/sdelements/node-slate)

Is great. It's free! I set up my own documentation at [nlp.studio](https://nlp.studio). It was very easy to write and to publish.

[Here is a great article about Slate.](https://www.bitgo.com/blog/using-openapi-at-bitgo) It's as close as you can get to a standard for documenting the overview and abstract concepts of your codebase or product.

Slate can document API quite well!  But it's great for documenting any kind of code - with English description in the middle column, and code examples in the right column. This version for Node.JS is easier to set up, and has fewer dependencies. The major difference is the use of [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for parsing the .md, [highlight](https://highlightjs.org/) for syntax highlighting, and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for templating.

## [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)

Install and host it yourself. No API reference docs, but otherwise great content and UI.

Docusaurus example: [https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation)

## [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

The original tool. Uses Ruby. Supports variables. Define variables at the top of the file, and use them in the body.
