# GUI builder

## [GitBook](https://gitbook.com)

It's a brilliant platform for editing Markdown docs. It generates a beautiful website from your markdown files. You can edit the ".md" files manually or use their GUI. After you save, your beautiful documentation website is generated and published automatically to your domain. It looks the best. 

Example: this site - [notes.paulshorey.com](https://notes.paulshorey.com)

## [Readme.com](https://Readme.com)

If you can afford $400/month, then definitely use this. It can handle regular documentation, and API reference, including versions. For the $400/mo, you can even include custom CSS/HTML/JS!

However... To use this,  you need to write your OpenAPI documentation 100% correctly \(dot the i's, cross the t's\), by specifying schemas for all parameters and responses. If you yaml file is not perfect, it will not be accepted.

Use this validator, to debug your file:

## [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)

It is the most advanced collaboration software for large teams. Multiple people can be editing the same file without merge conflicts. It has very powerful permissions settings.

But... Their UI is cumbersome to use and difficult to navigate. Especially for a large and/or disorganized team, Confluence docs turn out to be a big mess, because everyone struggles with all their bloated unwieldy UI. It starts out easy enough, but the more you add, the worse it gets. People use it because they have to, and use it as little as possible, to get it over with. All this leads to confusing and incomplete documentation.

However... If you have a dedicated project manager in charge of keeping the documentation organized, and especially keeping the navigation current, then this could be a great option, especially for larger teams!
