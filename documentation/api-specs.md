# API specs

OpenAPI v3 is the way to go. But, there are so many options!

### [Stoplight.io](https://stoplight.io) is a GUI editor which makes it really easy.

* Use the intuitive interface to create your specs. Include every necessary detail.
* Edit the `.yaml` file, if you prefer. It's great practice learning the spec to go back and forth between GUI and IDE.
* Export the yaml file, to import it somewhere else - like RapidAPI or Postman.

How to publish this? Stoplight.io is able to create a full website documentation. You can even export it in markdown format. However, their UI and navigation is pretty bad for site docs.

[Swagger.io](https://swagger.io/) is great. Use it.

[GitBook](https://gitbook.com) can also document an API very well. However, it is not currently possible to import/export as OpenAPI yaml files. That's a bummer, because OpenAPI is a requirement in tech. So, GitBook can not replace Stoplight/Swagger, but has to be an additional step. That's too bad, because GitBook API docs [look so good](https://nlp.studio/documentation)!
