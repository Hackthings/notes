Don't take too long to relax in the morning. Go on a run, get a bit of exercise, then start work immediately!  
**1 hour from waking up to sitting down - start the day ambitiously, by cramming that 1 hour with:**  
\* awaken, get outside, get exercise  
\* shower, get dressed  
\* make or get coffee, put together some food for breakfast while starting work  
**2 hours relaxing in the morning often turns into 3 or 4!**



Previous notes:

It seems I am most ~~productive~~ \(and happy!\) after 2 hours relaxing in the morning.  
Having a 1hr each way commute \(including getting dressed and stuff\) would take away from evening work/fun. It would also take away from morning relaxation, but not too much, because 1 hour is usually wasted in the morning anyway. Overall wouldn't be too bad - but the extra stress and tiredness of working in the office, dealing with bureaucratic frustrations and social anxiety - takes away an extra 1+ hours from work hours in the evening - needing more time to decompress, destress in the evening. Total take away 2 or 3 hours from work hours. But also takes away from quality of life - because an extra hour is needed to unwind after work, which is neither fun nor productive, and an extra hour wasted to commute to home.
