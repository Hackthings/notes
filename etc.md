It seems I am most productive \(and happy!\) with this schedule...

**2 hours waking up before work**   
laying around, going for a run, eating breakfast, playing games, drinking coffee, watching videos, reading

**work 4 hours** until lunch break

1 hour lunch break  
****sometimes take an extra 1-3 hours to rest or get outside or do errands

**work 4 more hours** until dinner

1 hour dinner break,  
some days take the evening off  
other days take another hour to relax, then get back to work for 2-4 more hours
