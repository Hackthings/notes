**`git remote show origin`** show url of remote repository  
  
**`git pull`** actually does `git fetch; git merge`  
  
**`git pull --rebase`** does not leave behind so many "merge" commits, making for a cleaner git history. It combines your commits and remote commits without making a new commit for the merge.
