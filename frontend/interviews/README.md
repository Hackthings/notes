* What's more important?  A\) clear, easy to find, easy to follow, thorough - documentation of the codebase, architecture, and how to set it up and run it B\) complete unit test coverage, with an automated system to run the tests before committing anything to version control  Some may say if you have unit tests, you don't need documentation, that unit tests function as documentation. Some may say that if the code is written according to the most mainstream conventions, that you don't need documentation. So, more effort should be placed on unit tests.  I personally have seen many programmers pretend to be better than they are. They are afraid to admit to having a hard time understanding the codebase, or having a hard time programming. Even with strict coding conventions, it is very difficult to read somebody else's code. When collaborating, it is important not to break others' code \(unit tests help with this\), but simply not breaking others' code is not the same as writing new features. To write new features, or to refactor the code, you need to understand the code. Documentation is paramount. Otherwise, the new developer will spend hours in frustration, trying to understand how the code works, when he/she could have just read a quick summary, which explains the architecture, and any quirks. So I say, documentation is more important.
