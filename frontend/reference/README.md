## Reminder: use and practice using generators

Generators I just found out may be even more efficient than for loops. Also, they're very powerful - can be nested - await a generator function inside higher order generator loop. Cool!

## Re-declaring a variable is not allowed. Just, put it in its own brackets.

This also works to allow variables inside a switch statement. 

```text
{
    let i = 0;
    let key = 'abc'
    // some code here
}
{    
    let i = 0;
    let key = 'xyz'
    // some more code here
}
```
