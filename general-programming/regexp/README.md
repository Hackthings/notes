# RegExp

## **Convert text list into JS object**

Read **left/right of dash**, write as key/value,  
account for more than one type of dash/hyphen  
`(.*?)\s?[â€“-]\s?(.*)\n` -&gt; `"$1": "$2",\n` 

remove periods, and any spaces before/after  
`\ ?\.\ ?` -&gt; 

remove "or" and any spaces before/after  
`\s ?or` -&gt;

remove parentheses \(and content inside parenthesis\) and any spaces before/after  
`\s?((.*))\s?` -&gt; 

Use equal sign instead of dash,   
account for previously converted lines \(ignore lines with quotes\)  
`([^"]*?)\s?[=]\s?([^"]*)` -&gt; `"$1": "$2",`  

Remove long descriptive phrases, 30+ characters in a row, which contain only words and spaces  
`,[a-zA-Z0-9 ]{30,}`  -&gt;

_**Before parsing entire file, add a linebreak at top and bottom of file.**_  
_**Don't forget to sanitize special character before adding special character \(double quotes\).**  
When parsing before/after a delimiter, left side add ? mark to avoid . wildcard from including delimiter._

## Swap JS object key &lt;-&gt; value

First, add this line to your .prettierrc file: `"quoteProps": "consistent",`  
because consistency is required for stuff like this to work, and for programming efficiently.

```text
"?(.*?)"?:\s ?"?(.*)"?,        ->        	$2: "$1",
```
