# Sandbox

[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/) - very powerful options to get started with different **frameworks** like Vue/Preact - though it's the most complex UI, it works the best!

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/) - great and powerful tool with friendly user interface - not able to import files from my repo at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulshorey/pauls-pure-functions/main/browser/index.js) for some reason! That wasted an hour of my time! So be careful with other domains too. More importantly, it is not ideal for sharing your code snippets, because you can not set the size and configuration of the screens, the JS, CSS, Console, etc - which ones you want expanded, which ones you want horizontally or vertically. Can't split screen between JS and Console vertically.

[jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) - buggy console logging - can't maximize by default or manually
