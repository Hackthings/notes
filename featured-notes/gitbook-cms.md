  GitBook is a brilliant GUI for writing documentation in Github markdown
  format. It automatically generates a beautiful website from your markdown
  files, and publishes to your domain.

# GitBook as a headless CMS

GitBook provides a really great editor app, to edit your documentation content, and any other content like for blogging or writing full articles! 

But, to share your documentation with the world, you have to direct people to the website GitBook generated for you. You can host it on your own domain and upload your logo, and it looks really nice. But, to remove their branding it's a minimum of $300/mo, and even then you can not add CSS or Javascript.

### But I am a programmer! So, anything is possible!

GitBook has a really great feature - the reason I use it at all... It stores all my content in my own Github repository, as markdown notes. Imagine that, you get to own and control your own content! Sure, self-hosted open-source documentation frameworks store content locally, but they don't provide a really nice GUI editor app, to edit the content. You have to fumble with their open-source simple editor, or edit the markdown yourself. With Gitbook, you can edit your own markdown, but also use their hosted editor, from any computer, on their website. The content gets deposited to your Github repo. They even generate a very nice navigation menu, also in markdown. This feature I have not seen in even the best open-source tools. You have to do it manually.
