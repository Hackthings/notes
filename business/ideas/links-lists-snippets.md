# Links / Lists / Snippets

Organize lists of stuff, in various formats \(todo, markdown, images, blog article, links, etc\)

Each list should have its own url, to be shared public or private \(logged-in/anyone-with-link\)

* listname.myaccount.mystuff.info &lt;-- at our domain
* listname.customdomain.com &lt;-- or connect your own domain

Or even easier, and this can be done right away \(proof of concept / MVP\)...  
Only manage the links - each link can be a redirect!  
Integrate url paths also, like a website composed of other websites.



With some automated web-crawling, and RSS inputs,  
This can grow into a content aggregator site platform, or RSS feed reader sort of thing!



Could even integrate multiple content sources, into an aggregate of online news/magazines,  
and charge one subscription to access each one!   
But at first, start by aggregating free "indie" blogs"
