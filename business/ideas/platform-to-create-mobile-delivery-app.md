# Platform to create Mobile Delivery App ?

## These look promising:

[https://loyaltyplant.com/what-we-offer/](https://loyaltyplant.com/what-we-offer/)  
Scheduled demo. Idk.

[https://limetray.com/](https://limetray.com/)  
Scheduled demo. Looks good! Will see about cost.

[https://www.restroapp.com/pricing](https://www.restroapp.com/pricing)  
Looks promising! Contacted them.

## Not quite:

[https://builtwith.crowdbotics.com/\#](https://builtwith.crowdbotics.com/#)  
$2300 upfront + $500 per month. Includes 20 hours custom development. After that $75-150/hr.

[https://cms.appinstitute.com/cms/app\_build.php\#nav-content](https://cms.appinstitute.com/cms/app_build.php#nav-content)  
Has a template for food pickup app. Don't see one with delivery option. Don't think I can do custom programming on this, to add features, like a delivery feature. Looks like strictly online app builder

Cheap monthly fee - doesn't look good - screenshots look cheesy.

## Most "app builders" are cheesy-looking Indian companies:

1. actually selling \*custom\* programming disguised as an app builder, or
2. offering a branded "clone" of \*Swiggy\* or \*Uber Eats\*, not for just one single-restaurant.
